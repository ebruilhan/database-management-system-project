# Bus Company Database Management System

This project designs a relational database system for a bus company and includes database modeling and SQL queries.

## Scenario (Project Requirements)
- Track which tickets are sold by employees (branch sales)
- Support multiple departures on the same line at different times during the day
- Record which vehicle and driver are assigned to each trip
- Payment rules:
  - Online ticket purchases: credit card only
  - Branch ticket purchases: cash or credit card

## What I Built
- Database schema (tables, keys, relationships)
- ER / relational modeling diagrams
- Process/flow chart for the system
- SQL scripts and example queries (CRUD + reporting)

## Files
- `database project.pdf` — diagrams + schema + SQL (project report)
